## Basic Information

There are two basic types of functions: those that use the values you enter, and those that use information from objects in the drawing. The arguments required by the two function types are different.

* **Number or text arguments:** Functions that begin with a lower case letter typically require a number value or a cell address as the argument. For example, the `acos` function returns the arccosine of the value that is specified in the function argument. The argument you enter can be a mathematical expression (such as `3/5`), an address of a cell that contains a number (such as `A12`), or an actual number. The argument for all trigonometry functions must be in radians.

* **Criteria arguments:** Functions that begin with a capital letter must be applied to one or more specific objects in the drawing. In a cell in a database header row, a function is automatically applied to the object listed in each sub-row, so no criteria argument is required. However, in a spreadsheet cell, you must enter criteria to select the objects the function applies to. For example, the `Area` function returns the combined area of all 2D objects that meet the criteria. To specify which objects to obtain the area of, either use the `Insert > Criteria` command on the `Worksheet` menu, or enter the criteria manually.

## Worksheet Criteria

For details about how to specify criteria such as the object type, class, or visibility, refer to the following page: [Search Criteria Format](Articles/Search%20Criteria%20Format.md).

Details zur Angabe von Kriterien wie Objekttyp, Klasse oder Sichtbarkeit finden Sie auf der folgenden Seite: [Search Criteria Format [auf Deutsch]](Articles/Search%20Criteria%20Format%20DE.md).

## Worksheet Scripting

Sometimes the report is so complex that simple worksheet functions are not enough. You can use [Worksheet Scripting](Articles/Worksheet%20Scripting.md) to report anything from the drawing.
